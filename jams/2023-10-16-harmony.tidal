-- I also rely heavily on all. 
-- One trick in particular really helps, which is to apply transformatiopn (ie. chop or timeLoop)
-- via all but leaving them bypassed. It works quite well to use a function to switch between id
-- and the transformation. This way, if you assign the control parameter to be a midi control
-- (such as a button) you suddenly have a highly interactive performance element to use anytime.
-- Using this trick with timeLoop is ðŸ‘Œ by far my favorite thing in tidal yet.
