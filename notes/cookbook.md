# Bag of tricks

- `jux rev` + `juxBy`
- slowed continuous patterning of effects
  - grain works nicely
  - basic filters also work nicely
- `pressBy` - simple way to pattern swing
- `segment` - used to discretise a continuous pattern - gives it a uniform structure of `n` events per cycle with values sampled from the continuous function
